### üìçIntroduction
This project, A **Data Analysis System for Airport Employees and Customers**, is designed to help users keep track of flight prices and timings. It also provides an interface for finding the cheapest flight between two locations. The project uses PySpark to handle large-scale data processing and DataPrep for efficient data analysis. The user interface is built with Tkinter, making it easy for airport employees and customers to interact with the system. By leveraging these technologies, the system ensures quick and accurate retrieval of information, 
aiding in decision-making and improving the overall travel experience.

### üìçFeatures
This project includes the following key features:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Utilizes PySpark and DataPrep to handle large datasets, ensuring data integrity and readiness for analysis.
- **Flight Price and Timing Tracking**: Keeps track of flight prices and schedules, providing up-to-date information to users.
- **Cheapest Flight Finder**: An interface built with Tkinter that allows users to find the cheapest flight available between two specified locations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use Tkinter-based GUI for both airport employees and customers.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data, making it suitable for airports of any size.
